The Carbonetes Analyzer is created specifically, to function as Carbonetes Helm Chart and recently added as Operator.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps deploying applications easily in a cluster. Helm uses [Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) as its packaging format. A chart is a collection of Kubernetes manifest files that can deploy a simple or complex applications.

## Usage

**Carbonetes Analyzer** is just an API that can be called within the cluster to execute a container security analysis. You can install `Carbonetes Analyzer` using [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/):

```sh
$ helm repo add carbonetes https://carbonetes.github.io/carbonetes-helm-chart
$ helm install carbonetes-analyzer carbonetes/carbonetes-analyzer --set carbonetesCreds.username="YOUR_USERNAME" --set carbonetesCreds.password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

### Via custom carbonetes-creds.yaml

```sh
$ helm install carbonetes-analyzer -f carbonetes-creds.yaml carbonetes/carbonetes-analyzer
```

> **carbonetes-creds.yaml** must include the following values:

```yaml
carbonetesCredentials:
    username: "YOUR_USERNAME"
    password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
```
